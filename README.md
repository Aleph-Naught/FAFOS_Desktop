FAFOS_Desktop
=============

The goal of our project is to develop a new look-and-feel component for the Fire-Alert 
Franchisee Operational System (FAFOS) including all necessary system modifications to align with the 
new additions. This component will simplify the use of the daily and most common Fire-Alert operations.
